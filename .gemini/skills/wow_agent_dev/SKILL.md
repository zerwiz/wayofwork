## 1. Multi-Agent Architecture (WOW-016 Phase 7)
Way of Work employs a decentralized, specialized agent architecture.

### The Orchestrator
- **File:** `.wo/agents/orchestrator.md`
- **Role:** The primary entry point for inbound requests (UI or Channels).
- **Behavior:** It **never** executes tasks directly. It uses the `dispatch-agent` skill to analyze intent and route the request to a sub-agent.

### Specialized Agents
- Defined in `.wo/agents/*.md` using YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  name: fakturering
  description: Swedish offer and invoice expert
  skills: document-generation, client-communication, project-pricing
  ---
  ```
- **Current Roster:** `claw` (general), `docs`, `kanban`, `fakturering` (finance), `forskare` (research), `projektledare` (heavy PM), `schemaplanerare` (schedules), `ata` (change orders).

## 2. Skills Definition
- Stored in `.wo/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Skills inject specific rules, instructions, or expected data formats into the agent's context.
- **Example:** A skill might instruct the agent to output a specific JSON payload when creating an invoice or dictate the tone for `client-communication`.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Constraint (WOW-010)
**CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:** Agents MUST NEVER execute writes to production data tables (e.g., `price_lists`, `tasks`, `projects`, `offers`).
- Agents are strictly instructed to create proposals using the `POST /api/pending-changes` endpoint.
- **Payload:** `{ change_type: "update", target_table: "tasks", target_id: "task_123", proposed_data: {...}, summary: "..." }`
- The user must review and approve this proposal in the Admin Console "Godkännandekö" before the backend applies the change.

## 4. Communication & Session Persistence (WOW-012, WOW-015)
- **Inbound Router:** All external messages (Telegram, WhatsApp) hit `server/channel-router.ts`. This module resolves the user ID, scopes the tenant, and handles authorization.
- **Bot Bridge:** The router passes the message to `server/claw-bot-bridge.ts`.
- **Session Persistence:** The bridge automatically maintains chat history in JSONL format using `server/wo-session-jsonl.ts`. 
  - Sessions are isolated per channel/user (e.g., `agent/sessions/channel/telegram/<userId>.jsonl`).
  - The bridge automatically trims history (e.g., last 20 messages) to manage token context.
- **Outbound Tools:** Agents can proactively contact users via `telegram_send` or `whatsapp_send` tools defined in `server/orchestrator-channel-tools.ts`. (Used in WOW-016 Phase 8 Daily Planning workflows).

## 5. Tool Registration
If an agent needs a new capability (e.g., searching a specific DB table), the tool must be:
1. Implemented in a dedicated file (e.g., `server/orchestrator-ta-tools.ts`).
2. Exported as an OpenAI-compatible function definition schema.
3. Registered in the execution switch statement within `server/orchestrator-tools-exec.ts`.
